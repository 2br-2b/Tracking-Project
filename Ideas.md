# Ideas for ways to track a user based on their text

## Without a keylogger
 - Number of spaces after a period (one or two)
 - Average length of words + standard deviation
 - Average sentence length
 - Frequency of non-period punctuation (dashes, colon, semicolon, ampersand, etc.)
 - Letter frequency: to be determined whether we should track this, or if this is too invasive

## With a keylogger
 - Words per minute/characters per minute (note - will have to find and ignore AFK time)
 - Most frequently deleted letters (to track common typos)
