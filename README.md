This program is a an attempt to determine if it is possible to identify someone simply based on their typing style.

Given a paragraph, the program will analyze it and determine who the most likely author is.

Note: I want this to not track words written, so that if it is applied to a larger-scale study, it won't pick up on accidentally-inserted information like addresses, etc. As a result, it would probably be best to not track sequences of letters or words (except for the number of spaces after a period). While this could be used to track people online, I want to be sure that this doesn't actually collect any personally-identifying information, and any information collected during testing certainly won't be going into the repo.
